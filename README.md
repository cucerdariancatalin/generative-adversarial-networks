# generative-adversarial-networks
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of machine learning models that generate new data samples by competing two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates synthetic data and the discriminator evaluates its realism, creating a feedback loop for the generator to improve its outputs.
